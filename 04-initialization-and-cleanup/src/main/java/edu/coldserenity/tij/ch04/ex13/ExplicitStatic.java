/**
 * Exercise 13: (1) Verify the statements in the previous paragraph.
 * <p/>
 * The static initializers for Cups run when either the access of the static object cup1 occurs
 * on the line marked (1),
 * <p/>
 * or if line (1) is commented out and the lines marked (2) are uncommented.
 * <p/>
 * If both (1) and (2) are commented out, the static initialization for Cups
 * never occurs, as you can see from the output.
 * <p/>
 * Also, it doesnâ€™t matter if one or both of the lines
 * marked (2) are uncommented; the static initialization only occurs once.
